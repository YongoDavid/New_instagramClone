following other users, sharing posts , liking posing and commenting on posts.

In this project the firebase firebase store is used to store and retrieve structured data efficiently.
Authentication Provides secure authentication services, allowing you to easily manage user sign-ins with methods 
like email/password,this will help verify users to be able to signing and login with the help of react-firebase-hooks.
